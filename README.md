## 🚀 Featured Projects

### Gatekeeper  
### Zero-Trust API Gateway & Management Platform

**Gatekeeper** is a full-stack **API security and governance platform** built to address today’s most urgent enterprise needs:  
access control, rate limiting, auditability, analytics, and abuse prevention.

This project demonstrates the design of a **modern API Gateway**, focused on **security, performance, and observability**, with a **fully-featured admin console**.

**🛠 Tech Stack**
Node.js · TypeScript · NestJS · PostgreSQL · Redis · React · Docker

**🧠 What This Project Demonstrates**
- System design of a **Zero-Trust API gateway**
- Trade-offs in **security, performance, and observability**
- End-to-end ownership of a **production-style platform**

**🧩 Problems Gatekeeper Solves**
- API exposure without consistent governance
- Abuse, bots, and uncontrolled traffic
- Limited visibility into API usage and risk

**⚙️ Core Capabilities**
- Centralized access control at the gateway level
- Deterministic rate limiting and quota enforcement
- Auditable, observable API traffic

**✨ Key Engineering Features**
- Secure API access using API keys and JWT with scoped authorization
- Deterministic traffic control via per-client and per-route rate limiting
- Full operational visibility through audit logs, metrics, and an admin control plane

**🎯 Why This Project Matters**
APIs are a company’s **primary integration surface and attack vector**.
Gatekeeper mirrors how **modern engineering teams design, secure, and operate API platforms at scale**.

### 🚀 OpsPilot AI 
### Enterprise-Grade AI SaaS Platform

**OpsPilot AI** is a secure, audit-ready SaaS platform designed to demonstrate **how AI can be safely embedded into enterprise operations**.

It focuses on **governance, scalability, and compliance**, not AI “demo features”.

**🛠 Tech Stack**
Next.js · NestJS · TypeScript · PostgreSQL · Redis · OpenAI · Docker

**🧠 What This Project Demonstrates**
- Staff-level system design driven by risk and trade-offs
- Safe, governed AI integration with validation and auditability
- End-to-end delivery via vertical slices with clear Definition of Done

**🧩 Problems OpsPilot AI Solves**
- Uncontrolled AI usage in sensitive enterprise workflows
- Lack of authorization, isolation, and audit trails in automation
- Operational risk caused by manual or ad-hoc internal tooling

**⚙️ Core Capabilities**
- Stateless authentication with fine-grained RBAC
- Deterministic workflows enhanced by AI-assisted steps
- Immutable audit logging for human and AI-driven actions

**✨ Key Engineering Features**
- Explicit permission gating for AI access
- Shared Zod-based contracts across frontend and backend
- Production-grade logging, health checks, and CI enforcement

**🎯 Why This Project Matters**
Most AI projects optimize for *capability*.
**OpsPilot AI optimizes for safety, clarity, and long-term maintainability.**
