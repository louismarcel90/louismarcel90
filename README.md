## Software Engineer | Architecture • TypeScript • Distributed Web Systems

**Designing and owning scalable production systems**

I focus on architecture, system boundaries, and technical decisions that drive long-term reliability, performance, and product impact.

---

## 🎯 Engineering Impact

I operate at the intersection of systems, people, and product to build web platforms that scale reliably over time.

- Set and evolve technical direction for production-grade systems, focusing on architecture, resilience, and long-term maintainability
- Multiply engineering impact through design reviews, standards, mentorship, and close partnership with product and leadership

## 🧩 Selected Work

### ⚙️ Gatekeeper  
### Zero-Trust API Gateway & Management Platform

**Gatekeeper** is a full-stack **API security and governance platform** built to address today’s most urgent enterprise needs:  
access control, rate limiting, auditability, analytics, and abuse prevention.

This project demonstrates the design of a **modern API Gateway**, focused on **security, performance, and observability**, with a **fully-featured admin console**.


**🧠 Technologies Used in Practice**
Node.js · TypeScript · NestJS · PostgreSQL · Redis · React · Docker


**🔍 What This Project Demonstrates**
- System design of a **Zero-Trust API gateway**
- Trade-offs in **security, performance, and observability**
- End-to-end ownership of a **production-style platform**
  

**🚧 Problems Gatekeeper Solves**
- API exposure without consistent governance
- Abuse, bots, and uncontrolled traffic
- Limited visibility into API usage and risk
  

**🧱 Core Capabilities**
- Centralized access control at the gateway level
- Deterministic rate limiting and quota enforcement
- Auditable, observable API traffic
  

**⚙️ Key Engineering Features**
- Secure API access using API keys and JWT with scoped authorization
- Deterministic traffic control via per-client and per-route rate limiting
- Full operational visibility through audit logs, metrics, and an admin control plane
  

**📈 Why This Project Matters**
APIs are a company’s **primary integration surface and attack vector**.
Gatekeeper mirrors how **modern engineering teams design, secure, and operate API platforms at scale**.

### 📌 OpsPilot AI 
### Enterprise-Grade AI SaaS Platform

**OpsPilot AI** is a secure, audit-ready SaaS platform designed to demonstrate **how AI can be safely embedded into enterprise operations**.

It focuses on **governance, scalability, and compliance**, not AI “demo features”.


**🧠 Technologies Used in Practice**
Next.js · NestJS · TypeScript · PostgreSQL · Redis · OpenAI · Docker


**🔍 What This Project Demonstrates**
- Staff-level system design driven by risk and trade-offs
- Safe, governed AI integration with validation and auditability
- End-to-end delivery via vertical slices with clear Definition of Done


**🚧 Problems OpsPilot AI Solves**
- Uncontrolled AI usage in sensitive enterprise workflows
- Lack of authorization, isolation, and audit trails in automation
- Operational risk caused by manual or ad-hoc internal tooling
  

**🧱 Core Capabilities**
- Stateless authentication with fine-grained RBAC
- Deterministic workflows enhanced by AI-assisted steps
- Immutable audit logging for human and AI-driven actions
  

**⚙️ Key Engineering Features**
- Explicit permission gating for AI access
- Shared Zod-based contracts across frontend and backend
- Production-grade logging, health checks, and CI enforcement
  

**📈 Why This Project Matters**
Most AI projects optimize for *capability*.
**OpsPilot AI optimizes for safety, clarity, and long-term maintainability.**

## 🏗️ Technical Foundations

- End-to-end web systems (React / Next.js, Node.js)
- Backend & API architecture (REST, Auth, Validation)
- Data modeling & performance (PostgreSQL, Redis, MongoDB)
- Production delivery (Docker, CI/CD, Cloud platforms)
- Testing strategies & system reliability
- AI-powered features (OpenAI APIs)

---

## 🧭 Development Approach

- Architecture-first, system-oriented development
- APIs as long-lived contracts, not implementation details
- Reliability, performance, and maintainability by design
- Iteration driven by impact and technical trade-offs
