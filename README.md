# Software Engineer | Architecture • TypeScript • Distributed Systems

I design, build, and own **production-grade platforms** focused on **security, governance, and long-term system reliability**.

🌍 Remote & international (US, UK, EU)

---

## Executive Summary

These systems are inspired by real production failures and organizational bottlenecks observed in multi-team environments, and are designed to prevent their recurrence through durable architectural primitives.

---

## TL;DR
I build systems that help organizations **make better decisions at scale**, by treating architecture, security, and governance as **first-class engineering problems**.

---


## 🧩 Selected Work

Each projects mirrors real-world scale, failure modes, and governance constraints observed in production environments.

## 🛡️ Scope of Responsibility

I operate at Staff / Principal level scope, focusing on :

- Drive cross-team architectural alignment through clear system boundaries, long-lived API contracts, and explicit ownership models
- Treat security, governance, and failure modes as first-class design concerns, multiplying impact via standards, reviews, and technical direction

---

## 🎯 Engineering Impact

I operate at the intersection of **systems, people, and product** to deliver platforms that scale reliably over time.

- Set technical direction for production-grade systems by balancing delivery speed, scalability, and long-term evolvability
- Multiply organizational impact through architecture standards, design reviews, and sustained technical mentorship

**What teams get :**
- Reduced architectural drift and regressions, with improved decision traceability and accountability
- Systems that scale reliably with both traffic growth and organizational complexity

---

## 📊 Measurable Outcomes

While these projects are independent initiatives, they are designed to mirror real-world scale and constraints:

- Designed auditable decision workflows supporting 100+ concurrent records across multiple ownership domains, mirroring real organizational scale and review processes 
- Validated architectures against real-world failure modes observed in production systems, ensuring long-term data integrity, safe rollbacks, and schema evolution

---

## 🧭 How to Read This Profile


This profile is intentionally structured to reflect how I approach real-world system design. While these projects are independent initiatives, they are grounded in production realities.


Each project aims to highlight:
- Thoughtful architectural trade-offs made under realistic organizational and technical constraints
- Ownership that prioritizes long-term system durability over short-term feature velocityity

---


## 🏗️ Technical Foundations


- End-to-end web systems (React / Next.js, Node.js)
- Backend & API architecture (REST, Auth, Validation)
- Data modeling & performance (PostgreSQL, Redis, MongoDB)
- Production delivery (Docker, CI/CD, Cloud platforms)
- Testing strategies & system reliability
- AI-powered features (OpenAI APIs)


---


## 🧠 How I Think as an Engineer


- Architecture is a product decision: system boundaries and APIs directly shape scale, velocity, and long-term cost
- Security, governance, and observability are designed-in primitives, optimized for long-term leverage and compounding impact
