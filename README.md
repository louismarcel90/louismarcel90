## 🚀 Featured Projects

### Gatekeeper  
### Zero-Trust API Gateway & Management Platform

**Gatekeeper** is a full-stack **API security and governance platform** built to address today’s most urgent enterprise needs:  
access control, rate limiting, auditability, analytics, and abuse prevention.

This project demonstrates the design of a **modern API Gateway**, focused on **security, performance, and observability**, with a **fully-featured admin console**.

**🛠 Tech Stack**
Node.js · TypeScript · NestJS · PostgreSQL · Redis · React · Docker

**🧠 What This Project Demonstrates**
- Design of a **production-style API Gateway**
- Secure API access using **API Keys, JWT, and scopes**
- Scalable **rate limiting and quota enforcement**
- End-to-end **full-stack architecture** (backend, frontend, data, infra)
- Real-world trade-offs around **security, performance, and observability**

**🧩 Problems Gatekeeper Solves**
- APIs exposed without proper access control or governance
- Abuse, bots, and uncontrolled traffic spikes
- Lack of visibility into who is using the API and how
- Missing audit trails for security and compliance
- Manual or error-prone client and key management

**⚙️ Core Capabilities**
- Acts as a **secure gateway** in front of backend services
- Enforces **Zero-Trust principles** on every request
- Controls API usage with **client-based quotas**
- Provides **auditability and usage analytics**
- Centralizes API governance through an admin console

**✨ Key Features**
- Secure API Gateway (API Keys + JWT)
- Rate limiting per client, route, and plan
- Client and API key lifecycle management
- Structured audit logs and request tracing
- Usage analytics and performance metrics
- Admin Console built with React
- Zero-Trust, security-first architecture

**🎯 Why This Project Matters**
APIs are now the **primary attack surface** and the backbone of modern applications.  
Companies need more than just exposed endpoints — they need **control, visibility, and protection**.

**Gatekeeper** reflects real-world engineering challenges faced by modern teams:
- protecting APIs at scale
- preventing abuse without breaking legitimate traffic
- maintaining observability and accountability
- building systems that are secure by default

This project is built to mirror how **production-grade API platforms** are designed and operated today.

### 🚀 OpsPilot AI 
### Enterprise-Grade AI SaaS Platform

**OpsPilot AI** is a secure, audit-ready SaaS platform designed to demonstrate **how AI can be safely embedded into enterprise operations**.

It focuses on **governance, scalability, and compliance**, not AI “demo features”.

**🛠 Tech Stack**
**Frontend**
- Next.js (App Router)
- TypeScript
- React Query

**Backend**
- NestJS
- PostgreSQL (Prisma)
- Redis
- OpenAI API

**Platform**
- Docker & Docker Compose
- GitHub Actions (CI)
- Monorepo (contracts-first)

**🧠 What This Project Demonstrates**
- Designing an **enterprise-grade SaaS architecture**
- Embedding **OpenAI responsibly** with strict governance
- Applying **Senior / Staff-level engineering practices**
- Delivering value through **vertical slices**, not isolated features
- Balancing **AI capabilities with security, auditability, and cost control**


**🧩 Problems OpsPilot AI Solves**
- Manual and error-prone operational workflows
- Unsafe or uncontrolled AI integrations
- Lack of visibility and auditability in automation
- Poor internal tooling not designed for scale
- Security risks when exposing AI to sensitive data

**⚙️ Core Capabilities**
- Secure, stateless authentication
- Fine-grained authorization and permission control
- Workflow automation with deterministic execution
- AI-assisted task drafting and classification
- Full audit trail for both human and AI actions

**✨ Key Features**
- **Secure Authentication** — JWT-based auth with OAuth2-ready architecture  
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** — permissions enforced at API and domain levels  
- **Controlled OpenAI Integration** — guardrails, validation, and scoped prompts  
- **Audit-Ready by Design** — immutable logs for critical operations and AI calls  
- **Redis Caching** — performance optimization for critical endpoints  
- **Strict Validation** — shared Zod contracts across backend and frontend  

**🎯 Why This Project Matters**
Most AI projects showcase *what AI can do*.  
**OpsPilot AI showcases how AI should be shipped in production.**
It reflects:
- Enterprise security expectations
- Real-world scalability concerns
- Compliance and audit requirements
- Thoughtful AI governance over raw capability
