## 🎯 Engineering Impact

I operate at the intersection of systems, people, and product to build web platforms that scale reliably over time.

- Set and evolve technical direction for production-grade systems, focusing on architecture, resilience, and long-term maintainability
- Multiply engineering impact through design reviews, standards, mentorship, and close partnership with product and leadership

## 🧩 Selected Work

### 📌 FlowDesk 
### Decision Intelligence & Governance Platform

FlowDesk is a full-stack decision governance platform that systematically captures, structures, audits, and evolves high-impact decisions.
It institutionalizes decision traceability across organizations, mitigating knowledge loss, misalignment, and the recurrence of costly mistakes.

**🧠 Technologies Used in Practice**

Node.js · TypeScript · NestJS · PostgreSQL · Redis · React · Docker

**🔍 What This Project Demonstrates**
- System-level thinking: decisions modeled as first-class domain entities rather than unstructured documents
- Architectural leadership: intentional trade-offs between delivery speed, scalability, and long-term evolvability
- Product & governance mindset: security, ownership, UX, and feedback loops designed in from day one


**🚧 Problems OpsPilot AI Solves**
- Decision loss & knowledge decay: critical technical and business decisions are scattered across docs, chats, and meetings, making rationale and accountability effectively unrecoverable over time.
- Untracked trade-offs: teams commit to architectural and product choices without durable visibility into alternatives considered, risks accepted, or assumptions made.
- Organisational misalignment at scale: as teams grow, decisions drift from original intent, causing rework, duplicated effort, and repeated mistakes.


**🧱 Core Capabilities**
- Structured decision lifecycle management: first-class modelling of decisions with explicit context, options, trade-offs, ownership, status, and outcomes.
- Decision-to-impact traceability: direct linkage between decisions, initiatives, and measurable business or technical metrics over time.
- Collaborative governance: role-based access, comments, change history, and auditability to support cross-team alignment and accountability.


**⚙️ Key Engineering Features**
- Intentional architecture & boundaries: modular monolith design with clearly defined domains, optimised for rapid delivery while remaining evolvable under growth.
- Security and governance by default: RBAC, ownership enforcement, audit logs, and schema validation embedded at the API layer, not bolted on.
- Operational and delivery maturity: CI/CD pipelines, multi-environment deployments, observability, rollback strategies, and production-ready reliability practices.


**📈 Why This Project Matters**
FlowDesk treats decisions as long-lived system artifacts, capturing organisational reasoning rather than letting it decay into tribal knowledge.
It reflects the ability to balance technical rigor, human workflows, and business impact.

### 📌 Gatekeeper  
### Zero-Trust API Gateway & Management Platform

**Gatekeeper** is a full-stack API security and governance platform built to address today’s most urgent enterprise needs :  
access control, rate limiting, auditability, analytics, and abuse prevention.

This project demonstrates the design of a modern API Gateway, focused on security, performance, and observability, with a fully-featured admin console.


**🧠 Technologies Used in Practice**

Node.js · TypeScript · NestJS · PostgreSQL · Redis · React · Docker


**🔍 What This Project Demonstrates**
- System design of a Zero-Trust API gateway
- Trade-offs in security, performance, and observability
- End-to-end ownership of a production-style platform
  

**🚧 Problems Gatekeeper Solves**
- API exposure without consistent governance
- Abuse, bots, and uncontrolled traffic
- Limited visibility into API usage and risk
  

**🧱 Core Capabilities**
- Centralized access control at the gateway level
- Deterministic rate limiting and quota enforcement
- Auditable, observable API traffic
  

**⚙️ Key Engineering Features**
- Secure API access using API keys and JWT with scoped authorization
- Deterministic traffic control via per-client and per-route rate limiting
- Full operational visibility through audit logs, metrics, and an admin control plane
  

**📈 Why This Project Matters**

APIs are a company’s primary integration surface and attack vector.
Gatekeeper mirrors how modern engineering teams design, secure, and operate API platforms at scale.

### 📌 OpsPilot AI 
### Enterprise-Grade AI SaaS Platform

**OpsPilot AI** is a secure, audit-ready SaaS platform designed to demonstrate how AI can be safely embedded into enterprise operations.

This project focuses on governance, scalability, and compliance, not AI “demo features”.


**🧠 Technologies Used in Practice**

Next.js · NestJS · TypeScript · PostgreSQL · Redis · OpenAI · Docker


**🔍 What This Project Demonstrates**
- System design shaped by explicit risk assessment, constraints, and long-term trade-offs
- Governed AI integration with validation, observability, and auditability built in
- End-to-end ownership through vertical slices, with a clear and enforceable Definition of Done


**🚧 Problems OpsPilot AI Solves**
- Uncontrolled AI usage in sensitive enterprise workflows
- Lack of authorization, isolation, and audit trails in automation
- Operational risk caused by manual or ad-hoc internal tooling
  

**🧱 Core Capabilities**
- Stateless authentication with fine-grained RBAC
- Deterministic workflows enhanced by AI-assisted steps
- Immutable audit logging for human and AI-driven actions
  

**⚙️ Key Engineering Features**
- Explicit permission gating for AI access
- Shared Zod-based contracts across frontend and backend
- Production-grade logging, health checks, and CI enforcement
  

**📈 Why This Project Matters**

Most AI projects optimize for capability.
OpsPilot AI optimizes for safety, clarity, and long-term maintainability.
