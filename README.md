## Software Engineer | Architecture • TypeScript • Distributed Systems

I design, build, and own **production-grade platforms** focused on **security, governance, and long-term system reliability**.

🌍 Remote & international (US, UK, EU)

---

### Executive Summary

I design and own production-grade platforms that prevent organizations from repeating the same mistakes — 
by turning architecture, security, and decision-making into long-lived system primitives.

---

### TL;DR
I build systems that help organizations **make better decisions at scale**, by treating architecture, security, and governance as **first-class engineering problems**.

---


### 🧩 Selected Work

The projects below reflect how I approach system design: from organizational decision-making, to platform foundations, to AI-driven internal tooling.

### 🛡️ Scope of Responsibility

I operate at Staff / Principal level scope, focusing on :

- Cross-team architectural alignment through clear system boundaries and long-lived API contracts
- Security, governance, and failure modes treated as first-class, design-time concerns
- Multiplying team impact via standards, design reviews, and technical direction

---

### 🎯 Engineering Impact

I operate at the intersection of **systems, people, and product** to deliver platforms that scale reliably over time.

- Set technical direction for **production-grade systems** with long-lived APIs and clear domain boundaries
- Drive architectural decisions balancing **delivery speed, scalability, and evolvability**
- Multiply impact through design reviews, standards, and mentorship

**What teams get :**
- Fewer regressions and architectural drift
- Better decision traceability and accountability
- Systems that scale with both traffic *and* organization size

---

### 📊 Measurable Outcomes

While these projects are independent initiatives, they are designed to mirror real-world scale and constraints:

- Designed auditable decision workflows supporting 100+ concurrent records across multiple ownership domains  
- Simulated multi-team environments (5–10 teams) with clear responsibility boundaries and access control  
- Architectures validated against real failure modes, ensuring multi-year data integrity, safe rollbacks, and schema evolution  

---

### 🧭 How to Read This Profile


This GitHub profile is intentionally structured to reflect how I approach real-world system design.


Each project aims to highlight:
- Thoughtful architectural trade-offs made under realistic constraints
- Ownership that goes beyond feature delivery, into long-term system health
- Systems designed for durability and reliability, not just short-term velocity

## 📌 FlowDesk (Decision Intelligence & Governance Platform)


### 1. 🧠 What This Project Is / Why It Exists


FlowDesk is a full-stack decision governance platform that systematically captures, structures, audits, and evolves high-impact decisions.


It institutionalizes decision traceability across organizations, mitigating knowledge loss, misalignment, and the recurrence of costly mistakes.


---


### 2. ⚠️ Problems FlowDesk Solves


- Decision loss & knowledge decay: fragmented decisions lose rationale and accountability
- Untracked trade-offs: choices are made without lasting visibility into alternatives, risks, or assumptions
- Organisational misalignment at scale: growth causes decision drift, leading to rework and repeated mistakes


---


### 3. 🧪 What This Project Demonstrates


- System-level thinking: decisions modeled as first-class domain entities rather than unstructured documents
- Architectural leadership: intentional trade-offs between delivery speed, scalability, and long-term evolvability
- Product & governance mindset: security, ownership, UX, and feedback loops designed in from day one


---


### 4. 🧱 Core Capabilities


- Structured decision lifecycle: decisions modeled with clear context, options, trade-offs, ownership, and outcomes
- Decision-to-impact traceability: link decisions to initiatives and measurable business or technical metrics over time
- Collaborative governance: RBAC, comments, change history, and audit trails for alignment and accountability


---


### 5. 📐 Scale & Constraints


- Designed for multi-team decision workflows, where clarity and traceability matter more than raw throughput
- Optimized for long-lived data integrity, auditability, and historical reasoning over time
- Architecture prioritizes organizational scalability (ownership, accountability, governance) over short-term feature velocity


---


### 6. ⚙️ Key Engineering Features


- Intentional architecture & boundaries: modular monolith with clear domains, optimized for speed and long-term evolution
- Security and governance by default: RBAC, ownership, audit logs, and schema validation built into the API layer
- Operational and delivery maturity: CI/CD, multi-environment deployments, observability, and safe rollback practices

Ownership and auditability are designed in, not added later
- I optimize for **long-term leverage**
Code changes. Architectural decisions compound
